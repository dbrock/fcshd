By using a client-server architecture, we are able to make the Adobe Flex
compiler run fast while still being usable in command-line environments.
In practice, you start the `fcshd' server, and are then able to use the
client program `fcshc' as a faster and more usable replacement for `mxmlc'.

$ fcshc --help
Usage: fcshc MAIN.[as|mxml] [-l LIB] [SRCDIR|SWCDIR|SWC]... [-o OUT.swf]
       fcshc -o OUT.swc SRCDIR... [-l LIB]... [SWCDIR|SWC]...

To compile an SWF, name the main application source file, then any
additional source directories, SWC directories, or SWC files.

To compile an SWC using `compc', you must provide the `-o' option, and
then at least one source directory, SWC directory, or SWC file.

Dependencies can also be specified by name using the `-l LIB' option,
which will search for LIB or LIB.swc in `~/.fcshd-lib'.  Both source
directories, SWC directories, and SWC files can be named in this way.

To pass extra arguments, use e.g. `-X -include-file -X NAME -X FILE'.

    -o, --output OUTPUT.[swf|swc]    Name of the resulting binary
    -l, --library LIBRARY            Search LIBRARY when compiling
    -X, --extra-argument ARGUMENT    Pass ARGUMENT to the compiler
    -p, --production                 Leave out debugging metadata
        --static-rsls                Use static linking for RSLs
        --no-rsls                    Remove all runtime shared libraries

    -3, --flex-3                     Use -compatibility-version=3
        --halo                       Use the Halo theme

    -R, --restart                    Restart the compiler first
    -n, --dry-run                    Only print the compiler command
        --verbose                    Also print the compiler command
    -v, --version                    Show `fcshc 0.6a'
    -h, --help                       Show this message

TL;DR: $ fcshc src/my_app.mxml
